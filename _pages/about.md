I am currently working with Prof. Shihab Shamma (Neural Systems Lab) and Prof. Carol Espy-Wilson on a multitude of speech and language processing tasks such as speech separation, universal source separation and speech production. 

During my internships at Alexa AI (Amazon.com), I have worked on Trustworthy Machine Learning, specifically Privacy Preserving Natural Language Understanding, and Acoustic Event Detection and Acoustic Scene Classification for Alexa Guard.
I will be joining Alexa AI as an Applied Scientist in June 2022. 

Prior to joining the [University of Maryland](https://ece.umd.edu/) in 2017, I completed my undergraduate at [Birla Institute of Technology and Science](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/).
