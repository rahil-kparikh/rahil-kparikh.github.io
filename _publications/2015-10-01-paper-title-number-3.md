collection: publications
permalink: /publication/speech_inversion_cortical_features
excerpt: 'In this work we develop a speech inversion system to predict vocal tract parameters using the cortical features of acoustic speech. We demonstrate that the cortical features are correlated to the vocal tract parameters highlighting that the audiotry theory of speech perception is linked to the motor theory of speech production.'
