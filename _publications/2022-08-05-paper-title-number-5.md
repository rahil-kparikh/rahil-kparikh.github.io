title: "An Empirical Analysis on the Vulnerabilities of End-to-End Speech Segregation Models"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/vulnerabilities_in_speech_segregation_models
excerpt: 'End-to-end speech segregation models like ConvTasnet and DPT-Net heavily rely on harmonic analysis for source separation, but show high instability when faced with minor signal deformations. Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that while these networks achieve good performance, their encoder module causes generalization errors that humans don't experience, suggesting the need for expert-guided redesign.'
