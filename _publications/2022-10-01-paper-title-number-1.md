excerpt: 'In this work we demonstrate that deep neural network based end-to-end speech segregation models cue on to the harmonic structure of speech for grouping and segregating sources. We demonstrate that these networks completely fail to separate inharmonic sources, and that they are unable to learn how to segregate speech when trained on mixtures of inharmonic speech.'
