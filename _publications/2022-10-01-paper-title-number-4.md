collection: publications
permalink: /publication/impact_of_acoustic_event_tagging_on_scene_classification
excerpt: 'This work explores the relationship between Acoustic Event Tagging (AET) and Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC) in a multi-task learning framework. Through extensive empirical analysis, we demonstrate that using AET as an auxiliary task improves ASC performance through regularization, regardless of the event types or dataset size.'
